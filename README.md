# notes-ludic-tech

My version of the [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) static site generator, using [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). This repo uses netlify to make my [experimental notes site](https://notes.ludic.tech).

This is, like, the fifth time I have tried to make this blog with eleventy. Something went wrong with the last go and I made it worse by trying to fix it, and I didn't do sufficiently regular git commits to do a revert I was happy with, so here I am like an idiot trying again.

This is, like, the fourth time I have tried to make this blog with eleventy, and every time so far I screw things up by trying to make it do clever things. That's creativity for you :-/

I really like eleventy so far, except I don't have the knowledge of JavaScript to really understand how things work under the hood. Hopefully by tinkering, I will learn as I go, as well as making the site my own, not just the vanilla base blog.

So this time, my intention is to use `git` properly, doing much more regular commits and making it so that I can revert to a functional site if^H^Hwhen I break something. Also it's good for documenting what I am trying to do.
