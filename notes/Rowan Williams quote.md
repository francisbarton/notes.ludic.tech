<p>Rowan Williams (yes, that one) writing about the Incredible String Band (listen from about 56:45 on the woebot mix in the link above).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those of us who fell in love with the ISB there was a feeling of breathing the air of a very expansive imagination indeed. It was all right to be enchanted, but not bewitched, by colossal and antique cymbals. All right, at the same time, to be thinking about the experiences of ordinary first loves and first betrayals. And all right to find the earnest nonsense of real hallucinogenic maunderings funny. There was no-one quite like them.</p>
<p>We liked to think it was a very grown-up taste but that makes it sound too serious. If I go back to the start I’d have to say it was simply a discovery of poetry, and as such, risking the embarrassment that so regularly goes with my particular vocation, I’d also have to say that it was a discovery of the holy - not the solemn, not the saintly, but the holy - which makes you silent and sometimes makes you laugh and which, above all, makes the landscape different, once and for all.</p>
