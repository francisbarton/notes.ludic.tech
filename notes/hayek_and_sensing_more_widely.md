I liked this crystallisation of a thought I've only ever had more fuzzily:

> ## From the edges
> There’s a kind of free market fan who cites, as one of their great lodestars, Friedrich Hayek, the economist who imagined a market as a network of sensors, all its participants out in the world, gathering information from the edges. Really good information: realtime, textured, context-specific. Much better information than you’d ever get in the central planning office.
>
> Acknowledging that many markets do not rise to Hayek’s standard—the market for complex weapons systems, for example, does not transport information very effectively—I happen to agree that a bustling, multifarious market is one of the world’s great information-processing machines. Markets can be healthy and exciting, full of possibility. They can help people begin things; what could be better?
>
> But here’s what’s strange to me:
>
> Those same Hayekians—who so prize information from the edges—are generally happy to accept the rote political alignment that leaves them enthusiasts of financial markets but skeptics of social liberation movements.
>
> EVEN THOUGH those movements for liberation are formulated and led by people who, in so many cases, are out at the edges of human experience, reporting back.
> What gives? Maybe the Hayekian believes that only a price, in dollars or yen, can convey the textured information they care about so deeply (a position that can’t actually be defended); or maybe it’s not really about information. Perhaps Hayek simply provides a convenient cover story for a deeper set of beliefs, which can perhaps be summarized as: *give me my money*.
>
> If true: what a bummer! Because that broader, “Hayek-plus” viewpoint is an exciting and useful one. When I encounter writers and/or activists making claims and/or demands that seem strange to me—when I feel the burn of friction rising: “oh, give me a break…”—I often return to it.
>
> If you believe that a customer buying apples in a grocery store in Milwaukee is a crucial sensor node, then I think you MUST agree that the same person—who, by the way, uses a wheelchair—is sensing just as crucially when they ask for better ramps in the parking lot. And the driver of the apple delivery truck, when he tells you he’s not being paid enough to live. And the apple orchard’s owner, when she explains her experience of gender dysphoria.
> In so many ways, Hayek comes down to “believe people.”
>
> Why is that so hard?

I suppose (in a nutshell if I can) the angle I'm interested in is the ways in which states and state-like institutions might be more aware of and responsive to what people want and need, if only they could get beyond price/purchasing/consumption as the only facet of people that's deemed interesting (the Hayekian/market view). The counterpoint to this, I guess, is that "talk is cheap"; what really tells you what people value is what they spend money on. But that just seems false, for the reasons Sloan hints at.
