## Factors and levels

### If you're not careful you can just rename the levels of a factor rather than reordering them

I did:
```r
levels(df$factor) <- levels(df$factor)[c(5,4,1,3,2)]
```
or similar and then continued merrily on with my analysis. You can even check to see that your "reordering" has worked!:
```r
levels(df$factor)
```
Everything looks fine and the levels are in the right order! Except... you haven't actually reordered the levels. It just looks like you have. You have actually just re-allocated the names of the levels. And your survey data that was originally tagged "Very unhappy" might now be tagged "Very happy"...

### How to do it properly
`df$factor <- factor(df$factor, levels(df$factor)[c(5,4,3,2,1)])`
Subtle difference... but rather important!

**PS**
A perhaps better way of doing it is:

```r
opinion_levels <- c(
  "Really unhappy",
  "Slightly unhappy",
  "Neutral",
  "Slightly happy",
  "Really happy")

phe_data_opinions$channel_switch_sentiment <- factor(phe_data_opinions$channel_switch_sentiment,
 levels = opinion_levels)
```
You then have `opinion_levels` as an object to use again if you need it.

Then wondering if
```r
phe_data_opinions$channel_switch_sentiment %<>% factor(.,
 levels = opinion_levels)
```
might work as a slightly more concise version of the above? Using {magrittr}'s [assignment pipe](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/compound.html) (**lightbulb moment!**)
