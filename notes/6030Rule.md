For the next 30 days, devote just 60 minutes of your time after work to the best opportunity in your life.
Nothing else.
Zero distractions.

Your single most important task within that time is to make even the smallest progress on your passion project.
You donâ€™t have to make significant progress. But it matters that you stay consistent.

Do not compromise family values to get ahead in life though.
Create your own balanced, fulfilling life.

If 60 minutes is not realistic for you: dedicate 30 uninterrupted minutes to it for the next 30 days and you will be amazed at the results.
You could even consider investing this time in your passion project in the morning before work.
Choose what works best for you.

However slow you move or improve, you will be deeply fulfilled in the fact that you are actually pursuing something you care about.
Something that means the world to you.
Something you have always wanted to do.
