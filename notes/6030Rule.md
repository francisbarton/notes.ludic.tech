<h1 id="the-6030-rule">The 60/30 Rule</h1>
<p>For the next 30 days, devote just 60 minutes of your time after work to the best opportunity in your life.<br>
Nothing else. Zero distractions.<br>
Your single most important task within that time is to make even the smallest progress on your passion project.</p>
<p>You donâ€™t have to make significant progress. But it matters that you stay consistent.<br>
Do not compromise family values to get ahead in life though.<br>
Create your own balanced, fulfilling life.</p>
<p>If 60 minutes is not realistic for you. Dedicate 30 uninterrupted minutes to it for the next 30 days and you will be amazed at the results.<br>
You could even consider investing this time in your passion project in the morning before work.<br>
Choose what works best for you.</p>
<p>However slow you move or improve, you will be deeply fulfilled in the fact that you are actually pursuing something you care about.<br>
Something that means the world to you.<br>
Something you have always wanted to do.</p>
